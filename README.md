**Step 1: Install Android Studio**
Make sure you have Android Studio installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Android Studio website.

**Step 2: Clone the GitHub Repository**
Instead of extracting a zip file, you'll clone the project from GitHub. Open a terminal and run the following command:
git clone 

**Step 3: Open the Project in Android Studio**
Open Android Studio. On the welcome screen, click on "Open an existing Android Studio project." Navigate to the directory where you cloned the GitHub repository and select the project folder.

**Step 4: Download the google-services.json File**
If your app is connected to Firebase, you'll need the `google-services.json` file:

1. Go to the Firebase Console and open the Firebase project linked with your app.
2. In the project settings, download the `google-services.json` file.
3. Place the `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory of the project in Android Studio.

**Step 5: Sync the Project with Gradle**
After adding the `google-services.json` file, go back to Android Studio. If you see a notification asking you to sync the project with Gradle files, click "Sync Now."

**Step 6: Build and Run the App**
Connect your Android device to your computer or set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) in Android Studio. Then, click on the green "Run" button in the toolbar.

**Step 7: Log In**
Once the app is running on your device or emulator, log in with the credentials you have. The app should connect to Firebase and retrieve the necessary data.
